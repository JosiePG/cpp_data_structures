# 🧠 Data Structures in C++ (From Scratch)

Welcome! This repository is a personal project focused on implementing classic data structures in **C++**, entirely **from scratch**—no STL (except for iostream), no shortcuts. Just pure C++ logic, memory management, and a deeper dive into the **low-level workings** of data structures.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

I'm on a mission to build a stronger foundation in **low-level programming** and computer science fundamentals. Instead of relying on built-in containers or libraries, I’m manually implementing data structures to understand:

- How memory is managed in C++
- Pointer arithmetic and dynamic allocation
- Performance trade-offs and complexity
- How high-level abstractions are built under the hood

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

| Data Structure       | Status       |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Singly Linked List   | ✅ Implemented |
| Doubly Linked List   | ✅ Implemented |
| Stack (Array/List)   | ✅ Implemented |
| Circular Queue       | ✅ Implemented |
| Priority Queue       | ⏳ In Progress |
| Binary Search Tree   | ✅ Implemented  |
| Heap (Min/Max)       | 🕐 Planned |
| Graph     | 🕐 Planned |
| Hash Map   | 🕐 Planned |
| Hash Table   | 🕐 Planned |

Each structure includes:
- A clean and readable `.cpp` implementation
- Inline comments to explain the logic
- Basic test cases in `main()`

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Strengthen C++ fundamentals (manual memory management, pointers, classes)
- Prepare for system-level programming and technical interviews
- Get comfortable writing efficient, readable, and robust code

## 🤓 Who Should Check This Out?

- Students and self-learners exploring data structures in C++
- Anyone interested in "rebuilding the basics"
- Developers preparing for interviews and want to refresh core concepts
